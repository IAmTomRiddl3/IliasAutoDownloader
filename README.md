# IliasAutoDownloader  
A handy little script that lets you download files from the e-learning plattform Ilias. It matches the online files with a local directory and only downloads the missing files.  
Only works for PDF at the moment.  
DISCLAIMER: This script is not intended to cause more traffic on the server, it is only mimicking user-actions.   
You can only download files from courses you have access to.
